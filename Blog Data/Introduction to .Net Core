.NET is a widely-used software framework developed by Microsoft, offering tools and libraries that streamline the development, deployment, and management of various types of applications, including web, desktop, mobile, cloud, and more. It provides a unified platform for building and running applications across different programming languages (such as C#, F#, and VB.NET) and offers components for common tasks like data access, user interface design, security, and networking. .NET includes the Common Language Runtime (CLR) for managing memory, execution, and code safety, along with a vast ecosystem of libraries (such as ASP.NET for web applications and Entity Framework for database access) that empower developers to create robust and scalable software solutions for diverse platforms and scenarios.
