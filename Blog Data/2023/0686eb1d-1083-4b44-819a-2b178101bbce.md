.NET is a cross-platform framework developed by Microsoft that provides a comprehensive ecosystem for building a wide range of applications. It encompasses languages such as C#, F#, and VB.NET, along with libraries, tools, and runtime components. With its ability to support web, mobile, desktop, cloud, and IoT applications, .NET offers developers flexibility and versatility. One of the key features of .NET is its Common Language Runtime (CLR), which enables managed execution of code, memory management, and automatic garbage collection. The framework also includes ASP.NET for web development, Xamarin for cross-platform mobile app development, and Entity Framework for data access. Thanks to its open-source nature and compatibility with various operating systems, .NET has gained popularity among developers seeking a powerful and unified environment for crafting modern applications.
